# ABSTRACT: create a new catalyst project with dzil new

=head1 SYNOPSIS

in C<{home}/.dzil/profiles/{profile}/profile.ini>

	[Catalyst::New / :DefaultModuleMaker]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

this plugin is used to generate the same files L<Catalyst::Helper> does when
C<catalyst.pl App::Name> is run.

=head1 EXAMPLE

You probably want more than just the bare minimum profile.ini, here's a more
functional one. I suggest putting it in
C<{home}/.dzil/profiles/catalyst/profile.ini>

	[DistINI]
	[Catalyst::New / :DefaultModuleMaker]
	[Git::Init]

Now you can run the following command to create a skeleton catalyst app.

	dzil new -p catalyst MyApp

Obviously C<MyApp> is arbitrary and can be named whatever you like.

or features depending on your opinion and the nature of the issue. The
following are known "issue's".

=over

=item * Doesn't create all the files catalyst.pl does

Some files like README, Makefile.PL and some of the tests, etc, are better
generated by C<dzil>. Use existing dzil plugins to generate these.
